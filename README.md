### Welcome to our GitHub space! ðŸš€

We specialize in **Offensive Security, Cybersecurity, and Ethical Hacking**, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in digital defense strategies. Yeah, maybe not exactly. But it sounds good. 

---

## ðŸ§  What We Do

We create robust tools for:
- **Pentesting**: Scripts that probe and analyze network vulnerabilities.
- **RedTeaming**: Tools that simulate real-world attacks to test defenses.
- **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)**: Gathering data from publicly available sources to aid in cybersecurity.
- **CTF**: Capture The Flag, Hacking and Learning Security gamified.

Some of our tools & scripts represent not a holistic, complete solution, but rather a piece of the puzzle. We like the `microservices` strategy in tooling, so we often build scripts that are meant to be used in a longer chain of in- and outputs, loops or other scripts. 

Due to very limited resources, we try to make use of everything we can, everything that's out there - and there's a lot out there. Tons of software, writeups and techniques we hardly could create ourselfs, but like everyone, need in our work. Imagine you'd have to build your own nmap, or Linux, or CPU... impossible. Why not go the other way then? Try to extend only the part that is not available, often times the **premium** where you'd need to pay for. Trust when we say, we would much rather pay for, if we could. It's a lot more fun to buy a service than to sit down for 18h and build a tool.

## About
    
We openly speak out against **Hate** & **Discrimination** - we believe, we're all the same, yet we don't have all the same `privileges`. No escalation jokes at that point. We believe, we didn't come from this world, and that why, it tries to eliminate us. 

**But we resist**
