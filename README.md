Fear not, you're probably like us and faced nothing but sh*t in this life. And if you're not - good for you, you're welcome like everyone. Please, only one thing: 

Try to **keep all negative feelings outside** of this place. This may sound esotheric - rest assured, that's not our philosophy. 

For us, `Hacking` always was a **peace place**. A place, where only few can enter, for their dedication and love towards tech, which includes building & breaking tech. We believe, this world doesn't deserve us, and that why, it tries to eliminate us. 

**But we resist**

### Welcome to our GitHub space! üöÄ

We specialize in **Offensive Security, Cybersecurity, and Ethical Hacking**, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in digital defense strategies. Yeah, maybe not exactly. But it sounds good.

## üß† What We Do

We create robust tools for:
- **Pentesting**: Scripts that probe and analyze network vulnerabilities.
- **Red Teaming**: Tools that simulate real-world attacks to test defenses.
- **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)**: Gathering data from publicly available sources to aid in cybersecurity.
- **Web Application Hacking**: Exploiting web app vulnerabilities to improve security measures.

## üñºÔ∏è Legacy in 3D Rendering

For over 20 years, long before AI democratized the creation of 3D images, we have been at the forefront of 3D rendering as an art form. Our renderings, especially those depicting `server rooms`, have reached over 30 million people and graced countless websites. 

Despite these contributions being available under `CC-0`, allowing unrestricted use, we have rarely received noticeable donations (< $10 total - what lucky bastards we are). This legacy highlights our commitment to the advancement and accessibility of digital art and technology. We'll keep on creating `FOSS` and `Artwork` without Copyright, truly believing in **Freedom Of Information**.

Thank you for visiting our GitHub! Feel free to connect or contribute to any project. Let's make the digital world a safer place together. 

Much ‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üíï `Love` üíïüß°‚ù§Ô∏è to everyone!

It's the only thing that can save us (but probably won't, as we all seem to try and increase the entropy. Nope we're not better than you). 

We openly speak out against **Hate** & **Discrimination** - we believe, we're all the same, yet we don't have all the same `privileges`. No escalation jokes at that point.
