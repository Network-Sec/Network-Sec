Thank you for visiting our GitHub! Feel free to connect or contribute to any project. Let's make the digital world a safer place together. Much `Love` to everyone, it's the only thing that can save us all. We openly speak out against **Hate** & **Discrimination** - we believe, we're all the same, yet we don't have all the same `privileges`. No escalation jokes at that point.
