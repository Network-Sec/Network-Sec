### Welcome to our GitHub space! 🚀

We specialize in **Offensive Security, Cybersecurity, and Ethical Hacking**, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in digital defense strategies.

## 🧠 What We Do

We create robust tools for:
- **Pentesting**: Scripts that probe and analyze network vulnerabilities.
- **Red Teaming**: Tools that simulate real-world attacks to test defenses.
- **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)**: Gathering data from publicly available sources to aid in cybersecurity.
- **Web Application Hacking**: Exploiting web app vulnerabilities to improve security measures.

## 🖼️ Legacy in 3D Rendering

For over 20 years, long before AI democratized the creation of 3D images, we have been at the forefront of 3D rendering as an art form. Our renderings, especially those depicting `server rooms`, have reached over 30 million people and graced countless websites. 

Despite these contributions being available under `CC-0`, allowing unrestricted use, we have rarely received noticeable donations (< $10 total). This legacy highlights our commitment to the advancement and accessibility of digital art and technology. We'll keep on creating `FOSS` and `Artwork` without CopyRight, truly believing in **Freedom Of Information**.

Thank you for visiting our GitHub! Feel free to connect or contribute to any project. Let's make the digital world a safer place together. Much ❤️🧡💕💞💓 `Love` 💓💞💕🧡❤️ to everyone, it's the only thing that can save us all (but probably won't, as everyone seems to try and increase the entropy). We openly speak out against **Hate** & **Discrimination** - we believe, we're all the same, yet we don't have all the same `privileges`. No escalation jokes at that point.
